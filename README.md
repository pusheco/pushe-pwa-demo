# A simple progressive web app demo with pushe webpush

This is just a html, css website that implements **PWA** with service worker and web application manifest.

In this sample code you can check out how to cache your site styles and scripts and also how to have a progressive web app
that can be installed in android devices like a native app with shorcut in **home screen**.

# Demo App

You can view the demo app in your mobile's chrome app ```https://pusheco.github.io/pushe-pwa-demo```, and after opening the web page after a couple of seconds 
a dialog will appear in the bottom of your page, and if you click on that you can install the **PWA** app and the shortcut will appear in your **home screen**!

# Install & Usage

clone the project ```git clone git@github.com:pusheco/pushe-pwa-demo.git```
then ```cd pushe-pwa-demo``` and then you can use any http webserver to run 
the project in your local machine and check out the page in your browser.

# Test webpush

To test the Pushe webpush functionality in the PWA we have already added the webpush scripts
and codes into this app and also customized the subscription dialog, so to use it just accept
the subscription dialog when it appears in your opended pwa app.
